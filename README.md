Certain networking tasks have a very simple format:

* Set up a given number of connections and initial state
* Loop until some condition is met
* Wrap up and close connections

NetSpec provides a simple way to write such tasks.

See the Echo example for how to use NetSpec for stateless situations.
More examples soon to come.
